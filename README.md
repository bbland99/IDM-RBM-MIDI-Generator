# IDM-RBM-MIDI-Generator
A slightly modified version of Matteo Kofler's/Dan Shiebler's/Siraj Rival's Pop Music MIDI Generator.

This TensorFlow/Python program uses code created by Matteo Kofler, Dan Shiebler, and Siraj Rival.

I have changed the MIDI files that the program uses to generate it's own MIDI files. I have also changed the output file format
from ".midi" to ".mid". This is because the digital audio workspace that I use (Ableton Live) does not read ".midi" files, only
".mid".

I have changed Matteo's version (Pop Music) that included MIDI files of popular music, to have IDM MIDI files.
The artists that are included in this MIDI collection are Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Oneohtrix Point Never,
a few Animal Collective songs ( to mix things up a bit :) ), and the only Burial MIDI file that I could find.
